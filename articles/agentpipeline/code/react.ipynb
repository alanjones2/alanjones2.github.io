      "Observation: The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where members have agreed to act as one. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market; enact legislation in justice and home affairs; and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development. [...] The EU and European citizenship were established when the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993. The EU traces its origins to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), established, respectively, by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and 1957 Treaty of Rome.\n",

The largest cities by population within their metropolitan areas are Paris, Madrid, Ruhr Area, Istanbul, and Moscow. [...] Note: This list includes cities geographically within continental Europe, some of which are not part of the European Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thought: This list includes some cities that are not actually in the EU, like Istanbul and Moscow. I need to focus on the largest cities that are also capitals of EU member states. Paris seems to be the largest EU capital mentioned. Let me confirm this by looking up Paris specifically.\n",

      "Action: wikipedia: Paris\n",

      "Observation: Paris is the capital and most populous city of France, with an estimated population of 2,165,423 residents in 2019 in an area of more than 105 square kilometres (41 square miles), making it the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2020. Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, science, and arts. The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the region and province of ÃŽle-de-France, or Paris Region, with an estimated population of 12,997,058 in 2020, or about 18% of the population of France, making it in 2020 the largest metropolitan area in the European Union.\n",
